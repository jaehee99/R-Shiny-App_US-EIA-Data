## Brief Overview of this R Shiny App 
- This app has been designed in order to explore the differences in energy systems across different states and over time. This app may be used by businesses and economists who may want to analyze both the “outputs” of the energy system, like the total amount of electricity produced or the total carbon emissions generated, as well as the “inputs” of the energy system, like the average price of electricity or the number of customer accounts. In addition, we know that for some kinds of businesses, like the manufacturing sector, a large fraction of operating costs pertain to energy alone; for these individuals, it would be useful to be able to compare electricity prices both over time and over geography to understand

## Data Source
- US EIA (Energy Information Administration) Data: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/
- Get access to EIA API query browser: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php
- For the main data, we track five variables by year:
1. Average retail electricity price
2. Number of customer accounts
3. Carbon emissions
4. Net electricity generation
5. Revenue from retail sales of electricity
